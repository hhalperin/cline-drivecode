/*
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * ADR-0025: a declared limit with no enforcement-path consumer is a defect
 * class. This workflow applies that lens to the product, repeatably.
 *
 * It is itself subject to the same rule. A run that ends in a document is a
 * declared control with no enforcement consumer — the exact thing it looks
 * for. So every confirmed finding must carry a `blocks` field naming the
 * artifact that would stop the defect recurring: a failing test, a CI gate, a
 * type that makes it unrepresentable. A finding whose only remedy is "someone
 * should remember" is downgraded, because that remedy has already failed.
 *
 * The five lenses are not generic code review. Each is a defect class this
 * repo has actually shipped, and each is cheap to look for once named.

const LENSES = {
  'declared-not-enforced': `A type, schema field, config key, or constant expresses a LIMIT (a ceiling, a permission, an isolation mode, a claim, a budget) and NOTHING reads it on a path that can refuse an action.
Method: find the declaration, then grep every reference. Test-only references do not count. A value that reaches a UI label but never a refusal does not count.
Known shape: \`effectivePreset\` is computed, capped by a correct lattice, unit-tested, and had zero non-test consumers for months.`,

  'measured-not-used': `A quantity is computed, parsed, or received from an external system and NOTHING acts on it. Displaying it to a human does not count as acting on it.
Method: find where the number is produced, then follow it. Does any branch, threshold, or decision read it?
Known shape: real \`inputTokens\` come back on every model response, are parsed, and are rendered in the status bar — while every budget decision runs off an uncalibrated \`CHARS_PER_TOKEN = 3\` estimate that is never compared against them.`,

  'guarded-not-reachable': `A guard, assertion, or validation exists and is CORRECT, but the code path that would invoke it is never taken — usually because a precondition it depends on is never satisfied.
Method: find guards that early-return or no-op on a missing input, then check whether anything ever supplies that input.
Known shape: \`assertCompletionReceipt\` correctly refuses to archive without verifier evidence, and returns immediately when no \`DriveRun\` is bound — and nothing in the repo persists a \`DriveRun\`, so it has never once run.`,

  'tested-not-used-path': `A test suite covers a configuration or code path that PRODUCTION DOES NOT USE, while the path production does use is untested. The suite is green and proves nothing.
Method: for each test, find the flag/mode/fixture it sets, then find the non-test callers. Do they pass the same value?
Known shape: both \`drive.wave.run\` tests pass \`syncComplete: true\`, which skips the execution block entirely; the only non-test caller hardcodes \`false\`. The untested branch reported success for work it never ran.`,

  'claimed-not-shipped': `Documentation, a README, a status board, or a code comment asserts present-tense behaviour the code does not have.
Method: treat every present-tense factual claim as a hypothesis and check it. Aspirational and clearly-labelled-future statements are NOT findings. Wording preferences are NOT findings.
Known shape: a reference doc described the room plane as an ephemeral Map that a hub restart ends, while a durable append-only log and a fold-on-rehydrate path had shipped.`,
