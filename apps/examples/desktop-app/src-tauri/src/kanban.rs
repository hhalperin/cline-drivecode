//! Host commands backing Kanban's desktop bridge.
//!
//! The TypeScript side lives in `apps/kanban/packages/desktop-tauri`, whose
//! `commands.ts` declares the same names this module registers. A mismatch
//! there fails at runtime with "command not found" inside a packaged app, so
//! the two lists are meant to be read side by side.
//!
//! ## Why the capability list is short
//!
//! `kanban_handshake` advertises only what this host can do today, and every
//! entry has a reachable path end to end. Three are deliberately absent:
//!
//! - `windows` and `runtime` — Kanban's runtime is still a separate process
//!   this app does not supervise, so there is nothing to point a project
//!   window at and nothing to restart.
//! - `actions` — no native menu carries Kanban's published actions yet, so
//!   there is no way for one to be invoked.
//!
//! `tray` is absent for a different and more interesting reason: this app's
//! tray already has a "N sessions running" item that Cline's own
//! `set_tray_status` owns. Kanban's presence summary is the same *kind* of
//! information about a different subsystem, and letting both write that one
//! slot would make the tray show whichever wrote last. That needs a decision
//! about what a merged tray says, not a silent race — so until then Kanban's
//! presence drives the dock badge and attention signal only, which are
//! per-window and conflict with nothing.
//!
//! The bridge turns every absent capability into a documented no-op, so
//! nothing here fails loudly at the user. Adding one later means teaching
//! this app to supervise Kanban's runtime the way
//! `ensure_desktop_backend_started` already does for the Bun sidecar, then
//! extending `CAPABILITIES`. Nothing else has to change — which is the point
//! of advertising capabilities rather than versions.
